## Main Goals

* [ ] Implement a `Graph` class that supports the API expected by `draw.py`.

*More goals to added as I progress through the repo throughout the week.*

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Implement the `BokehGraph` class in `draw.py` which works with `Graph` object instances.

*Stretch goals may become main goals later in the week.*
